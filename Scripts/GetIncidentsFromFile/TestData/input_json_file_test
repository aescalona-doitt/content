 Making a mesh on the move
 
 A new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, 
 reports Peter Rojas
 
 Peter Rojas
 Thursday August 29, 2002
 The Guardian
 
 Imagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from 
 anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting 
 for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or 
 download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.
 
 This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the 
 third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for 
 years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new 
 technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision 
 sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever 
 dream.
 
 Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, 
 are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. 
 Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, 
 with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time 
 ""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close 
 proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh 
 network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying 
 traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it 
 reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central 
 antennas, and improving wireless coverage.
 
 As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and 
 other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless 
 networking may be inevitable.
 
 Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless 
 networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users 
 connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a 
 dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection 
 speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The 
 technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed 
 wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range 
 protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even 
 faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.
 
 The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of 
 much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the 
 problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. 
 Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, 
 because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, 
 connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless 
 connection.
 
 Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed 
 to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building 
 cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all 
 that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 
 100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the 
 proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by 
 software.
 
 It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. 
 Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on 
 is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too 
 pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds 
 acquiring 3G licences.
 
 All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect 
 to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets 
 better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone 
 networks.
 
 But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have 
 high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, 
 and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing 
 music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When 
 UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.
 
 At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the 
 person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. 
 Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of 
 their favourite songs, movies, and video games.
 
 But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. 
 MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. 
 Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities 
 that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works 
 employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the 
 cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for 
 enterprise networks.
 
 The first place average users may use the technology is when it is 
 incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at 
 high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.
 
 When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in 
 your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service 
 was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually 
 someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.

 I successfully installed spamassassin & razor to run system wide on my
 Debian Woody server.  
  
 Briefly I 
 apt-get installed spamassassin razor and libmilter-dev,
  
 downloaded spamass-milter-0.1.2.tar.gz from http://www.milter.org,
 ungzipped and untarred the file into /etc/mail, 
  
 followed the directions in /etc/mail/spamass-milter-0.1.2/README to
 compile the milter, install the rc scripts, and edit and update
 sendmail.mc
  
 changed /etc/default/spamassassin to set spamassassin to daemon mode.
  
 verified that spamassassin was running by tailing /var/log/mail.log
  
  
 Woody/stable has SA 2.20
 Woody/unstable has SA 2.41
 
 I'm running the stable source live right now and it is working very
 well.
 
 If you want unstable change /etc/apt/sources.list, substituting
 ""unstable"" for ""stable"",
 Run apt-get update
 Install the unstable versions
 Change /etc/apt/sources.list
 Run apt-get update

 Im currently using woody.
 
 Is there a debianized package for SA on Woody, or at least somewhere I
 can download from? Its been soo long that I haven't compiled stuff, that
 Im sort of shy to try again. =)

 How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying

 You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
 miracle diet pill!""=A0 Like you, I was skeptical at first, but=20
 my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks,=20
 so I told her I'd give it a try.=A0 I mean, there was nothing=20
 to lose except a lot of weight!=A0 Let me tell you, it was
 the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
 as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
 to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
 at all.=A0 Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!
 
 I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
 and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.=A0I feel
 the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
 does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
 I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
 absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!
 
 If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having=20
 any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
 then I recommend the only product that worked for me -=20
 'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!
 
 You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
 actually work?""
 
 Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which=20
 is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid=20
 weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!!=20
 
 Here is the bottom line ...
 
 I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
 exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.=A0=20
 Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence=20
 to gain!=A0 You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.=A0 This is my
 pledge to you.
 
 BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!=A0=20
